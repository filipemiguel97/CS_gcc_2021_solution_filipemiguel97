# Global Coding Challenge 2021

##filipemiguel97 submission
This is my submission for the gcc coding competition. I placed 2nd in the UK region with 371 points. All of the submissions are correct except for the 7th question. I believe the reasoning is correct but there was an error in the code that I did not correct in time.
